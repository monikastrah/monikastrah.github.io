# Monika Schmidt-Strah

My training and professional work have focused on teaching, study design and biostatistical analysis in the medical sciences. I have a special interest in meta-analyses and clinical trials.

On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, book reviews and recommendations, news and updates on my current research projects. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.monika.strah@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
